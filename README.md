# Arduino Light and Temperature Sensors

This project is a scaled down model of a "Greenhouse Monitoring & Control System". In a greenhouse, plants require constant light. Many greenhouses adopt LED lights for this purpose. This project automatically switches the LED on/off based on light intensity. Similarly, based on the temperature, a fan is switched on beyond a threshold.

## Hardware Used
1. Light Dependent Resistor (LDR)
2. DHT11 Temperature and Humidity sensor
3. Arduino Pro Mini
